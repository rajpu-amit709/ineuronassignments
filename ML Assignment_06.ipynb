Its significance as an evaluation metric is that it can be used to evaluate multi class classification models and also works on models trained on imbalanced datasets(scores like accuracy scores fail for imbalanced datasets).\n",

As opposed to predictive models that predict a target of interest, in a descriptive model, no single feature is more important than any other.

R square measures how much of the change in target variable can be explained by the linear regressor. Its value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means poor performance and 1 means good.
