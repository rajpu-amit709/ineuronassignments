    "Question 1. Explain the architecture of BERT ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: BERT is an open source machine learning framework for natural language processing (NLP). BERT is designed to help computers understand the meaning of ambiguous language in text by using surrounding text to establish context. The BERT framework was pre-trained using text from Wikipedia and can be fine-tuned with question and answer datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is based on Transformers, a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is released in two sizes BERTBASE and BERTLARGE. The BASE model is used to measure the performance of the architecture comparable to another architecture and the LARGE model produces state-of-the-art results that were reported in the research paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for the good performance of BERT on different NLP tasks was the use of Semi-Supervised Learning. This means the model is trained for a specific task that enables it to understand the patterns of the language. After training the model (BERT) has language processing capabilities that can be used to empower other models that we build and train using supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is basically an Encoder stack of transformer architecture. A transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder network that uses self-attention on the encoder side and attention on the decoder side. BERTBASE has 12 layers in the Encoder stack while BERTLARGE has 24 layers in the Encoder stack. These are more than the Transformer architecture described in the original paper (6 encoder layers). \n",
    "BERT architectures (BASE and LARGE) also have larger feedforward-networks (768 and 1024 hidden units respectively), and more attention heads (12 and 16 respectively) than the Transformer architecture suggested in the original paper. It contains 512 hidden units and 8 attention heads. BERTBASE contains 110M parameters while BERTLARGE has 340M parameters."

    "Question 2. Explain Masked Language Modeling (MLM) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Masked language modeling is an example of autoencoding language modeling (the output is reconstructed from corrupted input) - we typically mask one or more of words in a sentence and have the model predict those masked words given the other words in sentence. By training the model with such an objective, it can essentially learn certain (but not all) statistical properties of word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is a model that is trained on a masked language modeling objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling approaches - Autoregressive approach (e.g. left to right prediction, right to left prediction). Masked language approach - Using prediction of a word using all other words in a sentence (the words in red in BERT case is masked out - replaced with a special token [MASK]). BERT masks about 15% of words in a sentence and using the context words to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masked language modeling is useful when trying to learn deep representations (that is learning multiple representations of a word using a deep model - these representations have shown to improve performance in downstream tasks. For example lower layer representations of certain models being useful for syntactic tasks whereas higher layer representations for semantic tasks) for a word using words from either side of a word in a sentence (deep and bidirectional representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "A masked language model is particularly useful for learning deep bidirectional representations because the standard language modeling approach (autoregressive modeling) wont work in a deep model with bidirectional context - the prediction of a word would indirectly see itself making the prediction trivial as shown below (the word “times” can be used in its own prediction from layer 2 onwards. BERT addresses this problem by replacing the word being predicted with a mask token) . \n",
    "However, we could also learn deep bidirectional representations without having to resort to masked language modeling by using the permutation approach of a more recent model - XLNet."
