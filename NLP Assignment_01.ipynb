    "\n",
    "One hot encoding is the most widespread approach, and it works very well unless your categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e. you generally won't it for variables taking more than 15 different values. It'd be a poor choice in some cases with fewer values, though that varies.)\n",

    "The Skip-gram Model: \n",

    "    The Skip-gram model architecture usually tries to achieve the reverse of what the CBOW model does. It tries to predict the source context words (surrounding words) given a target word (the center word). Considering our simple sentence from earlier, “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. \n",

    "    Now considering that the skip-gram model’s aim is to predict the context from the target word, the model typically inverts the contexts and targets, and tries to predict each context word from its target word. \n",
    "    Hence the task becomes to predict the context [quick, fox] given target word ‘brown’ or [the, brown] given target word ‘quick’ and so on. Thus the model tries to predict the context_window words based on the target_word\n",

This unsupervised learning algorithm maps the words into space where the semantic similarity between the words is observed by the distance between the words. These algorithms perform the Training of a corpus consisting of the aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics, and the result of the training usually represents the subspace of the words in which our interest lies.
