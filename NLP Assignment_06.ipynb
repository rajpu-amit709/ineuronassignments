    "Ans: The Vanilla autoencoder, as proposed by Hinton in his 2006 paper Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks, consists of one hidden layer only. \n",
    "     The number of neurons in the hidden layer are less than the number of neurons in the input (or output) layer.\n",

    "    This results in producing a bottleneck effect in the flow of information in the network. \n",
    "    The hidden layer in between is also called the \"bottleneck layer.\" Learning in the autoencoder consists of developing a compact representation of the input signal at the hidden layer so that the output layer can faithfully reproduce the original input"

    "Question 2. What are Sparse autoencoders ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A Sparse Autoencoder is a type of autoencoder that employs sparsity to achieve an information bottleneck. Specifically the loss function is constructed so that activations are penalized within a layer. \n",
    "    The sparsity constraint can be imposed with L1 regularization or a KL divergence between expected average neuron activation to an ideal distribution P.\n",

    "Autoencoders seek to use items like feature selection and feature extraction to promote more efficient data coding. \n",
    "Autoencoders often use a technique called backpropagation to change weighted inputs, in order to achieve dimensionality reduction, which in a sense scales down the input for corresponding results. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: A denoising autoencoder is a specific type of autoencoder, which is generally classed as a type of deep neural network. \n",
    "    The denoising autoencoder gets trained to use a hidden layer to reconstruct a particular model based on its inputs.\n",

    "Autoencoders are generally unsupervised machine learning programs deriving results from unstructured data.\n",

    "To achieve this equilibrium of matching target outputs to inputs, denoising autoencoders accomplish this goal in a specific way – the program takes in a corrupted version of some model, and tries to reconstruct a clean model through the use of denoising techniques.\n",
    "Engineers may apply noise in a particular amount as a percentage of the model and try to force the hidden layer to work from the corrupted version to produce a clean version. \n",
    "Denoising autoencoders can also be stacked on each other to provide iterative learning toward this key goal."

Unlike extractive summarization, abstractive summarization does not simply copy important phrases from the source text but also potentially come up with new phrases that are relevant, which can be seen as paraphrasing. Abstractive summarization yields a number of applications in different domains, from books and literature, to science and R&D, to financial research and legal documents analysis.\n",

    "Question 8. Explain Beam search ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most optimistic node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best-first search is a graph search that orders all partial solutions according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates. Therefore, it is a greedy algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search uses breadth-first search to build its search tree. At each level of the tree, it generates all successors of the states at the current level, sorting them in increasing order of heuristic cost. However, it only stores a predetermined number (β), of best states at each level called the beamwidth. Only those states are expanded next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater the beam width, the fewer states are pruned. No states are pruned with infinite beam width, and beam search is identical to breadth-first search. The beamwidth bounds the memory required to perform the search. Since a goal state could potentially be pruned, beam search sacrifices completeness (the guarantee that an algorithm will terminate with a solution if one exists). Beam search is not optimal, which means there is no guarantee that it will find the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, beam search returns the first solution found. Once reaching the configured maximum search depth (i.e., translation length), the algorithm will evaluate the solutions found during a search at various depths and return the best one that has the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam width can either be fixed or variable. One approach that uses a variable beam width starts with the width at a minimum. If no solution is found, the beam is widened, and the procedure is repeated."
